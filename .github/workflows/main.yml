          # CRITICAL: Specify the startup command for your Streamlit app
          # Streamlit typically runs on port 8501. App Service will map this correctly.
          startupCommand: 'streamlit run portfolio_app.py --server.port 8000 --server.enableCORS false --server.enableXsrfProtection false'
          # Note: --server.port 8000 is a common convention for App Service if it doesn't automatically detect 8501.
          # Disabling CORS/XSRF protection is often done for easier initial deployment, but consider security for production.
